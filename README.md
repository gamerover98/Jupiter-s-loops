GAME BIO
"Jupiter Loops" is a 3D, side-scrolling, endless runner game developed in Unity for PC systems in which the player takes control of a spaceship called "Jupiter-2." The story revolves around this spaceship which, following the last unsuccessful reconnaissance expedition, namely that of Jupiter-1, becomes trapped in a series of infinite loops caused by an unknown cosmic entity; the only chance to break the circle of loops is to collect, at once, all the crew members missing from the previous expedition and cross the last dimensional portal that will get them out of this continuous loop.
